## The Project

For this collaboration, we wanted a project that would allow us to design something functional and aesthetically pleasing. We also wanted the project to be a challenge. Due to our backgrounds it was more or less clear from the beginning that it had to be a robot but... what kind of robot?

The aim of this project is to achieve a robot fish. Fish are cute. But fish are also hard to make as they are wet, and electronics don't like to get wet. 

Our fish is customizable. 

This project is still a work in progress, but we deeply believe in the Open Source philosophy, so we are releasing our development files as we are developing and improving them. The prototype, along with other tests and experiments, will be displayed at the [Open Source Hardware Demonstration (OSHWDem) 2019](https://oshwdem.org/).

## Betta Fish: The Peleator

The Betta Fish (*Betta splendens*) is also known as the Siamese Fighting Fish, hence the name Peleator¹. 

We like this species because of three things: it's a though fighter, it's beautiful and easy to maintain. Just like us.

¹ For all non-spanish speakers out there, Peleator is a made-up-latin name derived from *pelear*, which means *to fight* in spanish. It also sounds like a name one would use for a large translatlantic boat, which (for us) makes it even funnier.

## Evolution

This will show the evolution of the prototype. The aim of the first version is not to be submergible, but to grasp a good notion of what the robot needs. Swimming is a larger challenge that will come later on.

### Early prototypes

### Working core

### Tail and Skin

## Building a Peleator

**NOTE**: THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. IT PROBABLY WON'T WORK RIGHT AWAY, SO PLEASE KEEP THIS IN MIND BEFORE BUILDING ONE. WE ARE CURRENTLY FOCUSED ON DEVELOPMENT, SO NO FURTHER SUPPORT WILL BE PROVIDED FOR BUILDING AN EARLY PROTOTYPE. YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN (GOOD LUCK!)
